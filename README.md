# Introduction

A Python 3 wrapper for the RescueTime API (https://rescuetime.com), and an assortment of other nifty RescueTime tools.

* rescuetime.py – The wrapper for the API.
* rescueupdate.py – Download your RescueTime data (sorted by day) to local storage. 

I will be uploading more tools (after I refactor my ugly legacy code), stay tuned!
