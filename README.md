# Introduction

A Python 3 wrapper for the RescueTime API (https://rescuetime.com), and an assortment of other nifty RescueTime tools.

* rescuetime.py – The wrapper for the API.
* rescueupdate.py – Download your RescueTime data (sorted by day) to local storage. 
* rescuestats.py - Once you've downloaded your data to local storage (using rescueupdate.py), you can get your activity time, category time, productivity etc. using this.

I will be uploading more tools (after I refactor my ugly legacy code), stay tuned!
